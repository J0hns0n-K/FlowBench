# Junmo's engineering workbook — to be authored by the student

Keep original explanations, sketches, failed predictions and revisions; don't replace them with polished AI prose.

1. Draw the actual seated-counting process. Which steps overlap? What exactly ends the five-minute estimate? Explain why the initial queue hypothesis was wrong.
2. Define success beyond speed. What error would make a faster workflow unacceptable? How could aggregate accuracy be checked without publishing student records?
3. Hand-calculate a three-group serial/parallel example before running the code. Explain why the coordinator can become the bottleneck.
4. Read `src/engine.ts` after implementation. Explain task ordering, ties, empty inputs and percentile conventions in your own words. Add one independently chosen counterexample and test.
5. Decide whether the provisional 120-second / 30-second targets make sense. Justify a different target or reject the change. Record the decision before collecting outcomes.
6. Propose an allowed observation protocol, including timer uncertainty and held-out validation. Record actual dates and roles, not future work as completed work.
7. Make a substantive change, link the commit and explain the before/after behavior and debugging evidence. Attribute assistance precisely.

추가 분석 과제: [같은 120초의 두 설명](IDENTIFIABILITY_KO.md)을 손으로 계산하세요. 전체 시간은 같은데 왜 대안의 결과가 다른지, 어떤 관찰을 더 해야 구별할 수 있는지 본인의 말로 기록합니다. 사용자 설명상 시간은 채플실 시계를 참고했으며, 이를 초 단위 스톱워치 자료로 바꾸어 주장하지 않습니다.
